                    This is the prject we have done in the IAT 267, its a smart garbage can system. It allows the user to select type of garbage and then dispose it into the correct garbage can. Our idea starting by seeing people not doing recycle well in the campus, and they put recyclable items into the dispose one which is not eco-friendly. Then we start developing why the doing this why and if there is another way to solve this problem. And then it leads to how we should further develop this idea. In the final states, we decide make a system with actual sensors which detect how far the people is, and the lid of the garbage will be opened once people walk close, and this prevents people throw grabe from a really far away distance. And the type selection system allows them to select the correct grabage type and put it into the current garbage can.

                    Mino is my team's winning entry into SIAT's 10th Year Anniversary competition, a conceptual interaction for a wearable bracelet. Tasked with the words "Social Innovation", I worked with Johnson Zhu and Carlo Lai to come up with the idea of enhancing greetings with technology in the background. The brief wanted us to address "social innovation" in a way that benefitted society. Our team consisted of a 3D modeler, a developer, and myself as designer. Immediately our group constrained the two week competition using our own interests and skillsets to make the project manageable. So we looked to technology trends for inspiration of how to start this idea. In the timeframe of the project (2013) Google Glasses were discussed extensively in media. For our group the aspect that stood out was the discussion of the benefits of technology without the disruption of technology. As we brainstormed different ideas, it needed to pass that criteria to be considered. Our group wanted to ground our decisions around keeping the human touch in our design concept.
